# Revamped Warbanner

Changes the Warbanner item so that you would _actually_ seek it out as a worthwhile item that is fun to use. Disables warbanner placement on teleporter initiation and level up, but spawns on equipment usage. Reduces radius from 16m (+8m per banner) to 8m (+4m per banner).

There is a compatability issue with BetterUI's tooltips where it will always display the Warbanner radius as 16m (+8m/stack). I have raised this issue to BetterUI's developer. The actual radius of the Warbanner is given by the "New Radius" tag.

In addition, the mod TeammateRevival appears to prevent summoning Warbanner using equipment. I have no idea why this is the case. At this time, TeammateRevival appears to be incompatible with RevampedWarbanner.
